Playing with arrows

Things I want to do:

- [ ] Escape shell so we can pass strings containing $
- [ ] Set of includes / modules ("Preload"?) - even a library to preload before everything?
- [ ] Pure / Monadic computation primitive classes? Like (HSLamb p a b)?
- [ ] See if we can pass interact as a lifting fn
- [ ] Support C/C++ (will require JSON support in a library)
- [ ] Separate stdio for tcc -run
- [ ] Use Category instance instead of (.) in HSLamb
- [ ] Why does PHP need an arg to destroy? Arg lists.
- [ ] Random function tests
- [ ] Tests "is correct" -> "is isomorphic to" when appropriate
- [ ] Faster tests! More parallelisation?
- [ ] Allow Nix to test using external tools
