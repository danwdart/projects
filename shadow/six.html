<!-- Some notes:
1. Polymer doesn't work if you've enabled HTML imports in about:flags currently
2. Polymer doesn't create a shadow dom unless you enable web platform features - it doesn't use the webkitCreateShadowRoot because it doesn't support the ::content shadowselector which it uses and creates a weird <shadow><content></content></shadow>
