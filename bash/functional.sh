# We work in the "IO monad"... everything standardly is printed a la ghci or auto-putStrLn.
# Variables are assignment
MYVAR="Hello World"
MYNUM=2
# We also have export, so that's like library constants I guess
# echo is "return" / "pure"

# Pipes are like >>= (every new command will have a new "IO" which can be captured and used as a stream)
# yes is repeat, head is init and tail is tail.

# Functions exist with variable arguments, and space, like in Haskell, is function application

# Bash natively supports networking without nc.
# Here's a demonstration of using it to set up a bidirectional pipe.

# Create /dev/fd/3 - this way we can hold connections and pipes open!
exec 3<>/dev/tcp/dandart.co.uk/80
REQ_DAN="GET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: dandart.co.uk\nConnection: close\n\n"

# -e will evaluate escape sequences
# Send to pipe
echo -e "$REQ_DAN" >&3

# Receive from pipe
cat <&3

# Close pipe
exec 3>&-
# or exec 3<&-

# With NC, we get the response immediately
echo -e "$REQ_DAN" | nc dandart.co.uk 80

# Looks like we need SSL!
echo -e "$REQ_DAN" | openssl s_client -quiet -connect dandart.co.uk:443

# We can also make auto pipes of these
mkfifo bob
echo -e "$REQ_DAN" | openssl s_client -quiet -connect dandart.co.uk:443 > bob &
cat bob
# cleanup
rm bob

# We can even interact with system pipes and send ourselves messages in other ways.
# We can find pipes with find ~ -type p -perm +rw 2>/dev/null, or with lsof / netstat.
# Sockets with find ~ -type s & blocks with find ~ -type b
# To interact with sockets, we need nc, I think
# TODO EOF
